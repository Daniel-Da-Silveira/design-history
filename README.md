This repository makes it easy to:

* screenshot your designs
* create pages of screenshots to document designs
* document designs using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
* print pages of designs
* make designs shareable and linkable

The design history uses the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) and the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator.
